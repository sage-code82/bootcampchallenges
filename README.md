## Reading Week Challenges

Welcome to my Reading Week Challenges page! The teaching team at Tech Educators have set us a handful of challenges to help us keep the coding skills we have fresh in the memory. I have chosen a two-sum challenge, Whack-a-Mole, and Tic-Tac-Toe.

This page is going to be a record of what stage I have managed to get to, as well as highlighting any issues I might have in getting me across the line with each challenge. If you wish to go back to the home page, please click [HERE](#) (GET LINKS TO WORK 18.10.23).

#### [R2-Sum]

A simple bit of JavaScript magic! Type in a number when prompted, and the computer's mega brain will be able to choose two numbers from the array that will add up to the number you want. This is now at the MVP stage, but some changes I am looking to make as of 18.10.23 are:

- Adjust the CSS to make the page more uniform with the rest of the site.
- Have an animation on the page of R2 rolling across the bottom of the page.
- Move the button to the dead center of the page.

#### [Whack-a-Wookie]

A classic fairground game with a Star Wars twist!

The game is working at MVP! It is just at the stage now where I need to make the game look nice and pretty. Things I will be looking to change as of 18.10.23:

- Resize the Wookie heads to make them fit the game board a bit better.
- Adjust the CSS to make the page more uniform with the rest of the site.
- Add a timer.
- Wookie noises when a Wookie pops its head up.
- Music that plays when the game starts (a further stretch goal of the music speeding up as the time comes to an end).

#### [Darth and Yoda]

Tic-Tac-Toe with (you guessed it) a Star Wars twist!

The game is working at MVP! Similar to Whack-a-Wookie, I just need to make the game look a bit presentable and add some stretch goals (18.03.23):

- Adjust the CSS to make it more uniform to the rest of the page.
- Replace 'o's and 'x's with an image of Darth Vader and Yoda.
- The game is currently 2 player; look into being able to play against the "computer."
