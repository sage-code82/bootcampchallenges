    <h2>Reading Week Challenges</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to my Reading Week Challenges page! The teaching team at Tech
      Educators have set us a handful of challenges to help us keep the coding
      skills we have fresh in the memory. I have chosen a two-sum challenge,
      Whack-a-Mole and Tic-Tac-Toe.
    </p>

    <p>
      This page is going to be a record of what stage I have managed to get to!
      As well as highlighting any issues I might have any getting me across the
      line with each challenge. If you wish to go back to the home page then
      please click <a href="index.html">HERE.</a> 
    </p>

    <h4><a href="twosum.html">R2-Sum</a></h4>
    <p>
      A simple bit of JavaScript magic! Type in a number when prompted and the
      compute mega brain will be able to choose two numbers from the array that
      will add up to the number you want.  This is now at the MVP stage but some changes I am looking to make as of 21.10.23 are 
      <ul>
        <li> Adjust the CSS to make the page more uniform with the rest of the site</li>
        <li> Look into the R2 animation sometimes goes "off the page"</li>
        <li> R2 Noise while he rolls across the board</li>
        <li> Look into why the number array does not select the same number twice i.e. pick 26 and get 13+13</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h4><a href="WhackaWookie.html">Whack-a-Wookie</a></h4>
    <p>A classic fairground game with a Star Wars twist!</p>

    <p>
      The game is working at MVP!  It is just at the stage now where I need to make the game look nice and pretty. Things I will be looking to change as of 21.10.23
      <ul>
        <li> Resize the wookie heads to make them fit the game board a bit better</li>
        <li> Adjust the CSS to make the page more uniform with the rest of the site</li>
        <li> Add a timeer</li>
        <li> Wookie noises when a wookie pops its head up!</li>
        <li> Musis that plays when the game starts (a further stretch goal of the music speeds up as the time comes to an end)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h4><a href="darthandyoda.html">Darth and Yoda</a></h4>
    <p>Tic-Tac-Toe with (you guessed it) a Star Wars twist!</p>

    <p> The game is working at MVP! Similar to Whack-a-Wookie I just need to make the game look a bit presentable and add some stretch goals (21.03.23)
      <ul>
        <li> Adjust the CSS to make it more uniform to the rest of the page </li>
        <li> Replace o's and x's with an image of Darth Vader and Yoda </li>
        <li> The game is currently 2 player look in to being able to play against the "computer"</li>
      </ul>
